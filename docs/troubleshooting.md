# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Docker Build Failures
If you encounter issues while building the Docker container, ensure:
- Docker is installed and running.
- You have the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.

### AWS CLI Errors
If you face errors with AWS CLI commands, verify:
- AWS CLI is installed and configured with the correct access keys.
- Your IAM user has the necessary permissions.

### Glue Job Failures
Common reasons for Glue job failures include:
- Incorrect S3 paths: Verify that the paths in your Glue scripts are correct.
- Missing dependencies: Ensure all required JAR files and Python libraries are available.

### Jupyter Notebook Issues
If Jupyter notebooks fail to start:
- Verify that the Docker container is running.
- Check the Docker logs for any errors related to Jupyter.

## Logging and Monitoring
Use CloudWatch logs to monitor Glue job runs and Lambda functions. Ensure logging is enabled in your CloudFormation templates.

## Debugging Tips
- Add print statements or logging to your scripts to trace issues.
- Use the AWS Console to manually trigger and debug Glue jobs and Lambda functions.
