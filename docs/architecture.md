# Architecture

## Overview
The AWS Data Lake Project leverages several AWS services to create a scalable, flexible, and efficient data lake. The key components include:

### S3
S3 is used for data storage, organized into raw, processed, and cleaned data buckets.

### Glue
AWS Glue is used for data cataloging and ETL processes. Glue jobs transform raw data and load it into the processed layer.

### Athena
Athena is used for querying data directly from S3 using SQL.

### SageMaker
SageMaker is utilized for training machine learning models and making predictions.

### Lambda
Lambda functions are used for lightweight ETL processes and orchestrating workflows.

### Great Expectations
Great Expectations is used for data validation and quality checks.

### dbt
dbt (data build tool) is used for data transformation and creating a unified data model.

## Data Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data is ingested into the S3 `raw` bucket.
2. **Data Processing**: Glue jobs transform raw data and store it in the `processed` bucket.
3. **Data Validation**: Great Expectations validates the processed data.
4. **Data Analysis**: Athena queries and dbt models analyze the processed data.
5. **Machine Learning**: SageMaker models use the processed data for training and predictions.

## Infrastructure as Code
CloudFormation templates in the `src/cloudformation` directory define the infrastructure for VPC, S3 buckets, Glue resources, and more.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement Lake Formation for fine-grained access control.
- Integrate additional data sources and workflows.
